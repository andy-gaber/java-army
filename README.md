# army

Program that simulates an army containing 20 regiments of soldiers who will be shipped off to war. Initially the first regiment gets 1000 soldiers, and each following regiment get 50 less soldiers than the previous. Each week every regiment gets an additional 100 soldiers, except the fifth regiment which will only get an additional 30 soldiers; the regiment with the most soldiers that week will be shipped off to war. The program progresses through 20 weeks until all regiments are shipped.
